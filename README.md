## About the Project

**C2W** (Class to World) is an online learning platform that uses Artificial Intelligence to adapt educational content according to the student's learning style. The platform allows for the creation of personalized courses that are continuously optimized based on students' performance and preferences using machine learning algorithms ad other stuff.

### Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Artificial Intelligence: [Matplotlib,Sklearn]
- Database: SQLite3
- Other Tools: Git

## Features

- **Personalized Courses:** The platform adapts the content and difficulty of courses based on student progress.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** The system is powered by machine learning algorithms that recommend activities and content based on student behavior.
- **Course Management:** Creation, editing, and management of courses for various areas of knowledge.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Detailed reports on student performance, with insights generated by AI.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask 3.0 or higher
- [AI Tool: Matplotlib,Sklearn]
- SQLite3

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
   https://github.com/allanlealluz/C2W-SAMSUNG_Project
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd C2W-SAMSUNG_Project
    ```

3. Create and activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Configure environment variables:
